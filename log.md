## Saturday 18th

### 10:00
Woke up after plenty of sleep but with several hours after the kick-off of Ludum Dare. I went to check the theme, and it ended being the one that I wanted the least... **Keep it alive...**
In my initial brainstorming, the only idea I came up with was as ridiculous as impossible to translate into a game, at least with the short time at disposal:

> "The quest of a man to make disco music hype again"

Yeah, that sounds fun. But I've to come up with more apt ideas.
Not before breakfast though.

### 11:38
Ok, a short breakfast but a long phone call later I'm finally ready. The jam is almost 9 hours deep and I yet have to come up with a single feasible idea.
Many pro at this point already have sketched narratives and mechanisms, figured out graphic designs, tested prototypes and few might be even close to submission.
I don't even know where to start.
Let's grab some pen & paper and get some shit together.
